# ARKit
Some playing and testing with the new ARKit Framework.

## Why I started this project

I’m always been interested in Augmented Reality (AR). In the past I made AR applications with library’s such as [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com), but with the new ARKit framework I’m curious of making native iOS applications with this Apple framework. My goal is to build a fun project with several features of ARKit and maybe I process some Vision framework features too.

The TODO list is just for you to know what I’m planning to implement.

### Features

* Plane Detection through ARKit framework
* Searching for QR Codes through Vision framework
* Adding 3D object on found QR Code through ARKit framework

## TODO

* Give the user some nice feedback when searching for planes
* Placing the 3D objects right on the QR Code - currently a little bit moved
* Making a algorithm
